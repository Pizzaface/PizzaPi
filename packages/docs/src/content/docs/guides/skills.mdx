import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

**Skills** are markdown (or MDX) files that give the `pi` agent specialized knowledge, workflows, or instructions for a particular domain. PizzaPi automatically loads skills from well-known directories and makes them available to every session.

---

## Skill Discovery

PizzaPi searches for skills in these locations (all merged):

| Path | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `~/.pizzapi/skills/` | Global — available in all projects |
| `<cwd>/.pizzapi/skills/` | Project-local — scoped to this repo |
| Paths in the `skills` config array | Custom locations |

---

## Writing a Skill

A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

<FileTree>
- .pizzapi/
  - skills/
    - my-skill/
      - **SKILL.md**
      - helpers.md
      - examples/
        - example-1.md
</FileTree>

### `SKILL.md` structure

```markdown
# My Skill Name

A one-line description of what this skill does.

## When to Use This Skill

Describe the situations where the agent should apply this skill.

## Instructions

Step-by-step guidance, rules, or domain knowledge the agent should follow.

## Examples

Include examples to help the agent understand expected behavior.
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Skills are loaded into the agent's context at startup. Keep them focused and concise — one skill per domain works best.

## Built-in PizzaPi Extensions

PizzaPi ships with several built-in extensions that are always active:

| Extension | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **remote** | Streams all session events (tokens, tool calls, file diffs) to the relay server |
| **mcp** | Bridges Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into the agent's tool set |
| **restart** | Allows the agent to restart itself within a session |
| **set-session-name** | Gives the agent the `set_session_name` tool to title sessions in the UI |
| **update-todo** | Gives the agent the `update_todo` tool to maintain a live task list in the UI |
| **spawn-session** | Gives the agent the `spawn_session` tool to launch sub-sessions via the runner |
| **session-messaging** | Gives the agent `send_message`, `wait_for_message`, and `check_messages` tools for inter-agent communication |

---

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

PizzaPi supports connecting **MCP servers** to the agent, giving it access to additional tools (web search, file access, databases, etc.).

### Configuration

MCP servers are configured in your `pi` configuration (not PizzaPi config). Refer to the [pi documentation](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) for MCP setup details.

PizzaPi's `mcp-extension` automatically bridges any configured MCP servers into the agent's tool set for every session.

## Example: Project-Local Skill

Create `.pizzapi/skills/nextjs/SKILL.md` in your Next.js project:

```markdown
# Next.js 15 App Router

Use this skill when working on Next.js projects.

## Rules

- Always use TypeScript
- Use the App Router (not Pages Router)
- Server Components by default; add `"use client"` only when needed
- Use `next/image` for all images
- API routes go in `app/api/route.ts`

## File Structure

- `app/` — pages and layouts
- `app/api/` — API routes
- `components/` — shared UI components
- `lib/` — utilities and server-only code
```

This skill will automatically be available to every `pizzapi` session started from that project directory.
