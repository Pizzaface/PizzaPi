## Synopsis

```
pizzapi [command] [options]
```

When called without a command, `pizzapi` starts an **interactive coding session** and streams it to the configured relay server.

---

## Commands

### `pizzapi` (default)

Start an interactive `pi` coding session and relay it to the web UI.

```bash
pizzapi
pizzapi --cwd /path/to/project
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--cwd <path>` | Working directory for the session (default: current directory) |

The session ID is derived from the runner configuration and displayed on startup. Open the relay server's web UI to watch the session live.

---

### `pizzapi setup`

Run (or re-run) the first-time setup wizard. Prompts for the relay server URL, email, and password, then saves the API key to `~/.pizzapi/config.json`.

```bash
pizzapi setup
```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can re-run setup at any time to switch relay servers or update credentials.
</Aside>

---

### `pizzapi runner`

Start the **headless runner daemon**. The daemon registers with the relay server and waits for session-spawn requests from the web UI or from agents using the `spawn_session` tool.

```bash
# Start the runner (foreground)
pizzapi runner

# Start the runner in the background
pizzapi runner &

# Stop a running daemon
pizzapi runner stop
```

See the [Runner Daemon guide](/PizzaPi/guides/runner-daemon/) for detailed usage.

---

### `pizzapi runner stop`

Send a stop signal to the currently running runner daemon.

```bash
pizzapi runner stop
```

---

### `pizzapi usage`

Show accumulated API usage across all providers.

```bash
# Summary for all providers
pizzapi usage

# Filter to a specific provider
pizzapi usage anthropic
pizzapi usage gemini
pizzapi usage openai

# Machine-readable JSON output
pizzapi usage --json
```

Output format:

```
Provider       Tokens In    Tokens Out    Cost
─────────────────────────────────────────────
anthropic      1,234,567    456,789       $12.34
gemini         234,567      89,012         $2.10
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                                     $14.44
```

---

### `pizzapi models`

List all AI models available through the configured providers.

```bash
# Human-readable table
pizzapi models

# Machine-readable JSON
pizzapi models --json
```

---

### `pizzapi --version`

Print the installed version number and exit.

```bash
pizzapi --version
# 1.2.3
```

---

## Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--version` | Print version and exit |
| `--cwd <path>` | Override working directory (applies to the default session command) |

---

## Internal Commands

These commands are used internally by the daemon and should not be called directly:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pizzapi _daemon` | Internal daemon entrypoint (spawned by the supervisor) |
| `pizzapi _worker` | Internal worker entrypoint (spawned by the daemon for each session) |
