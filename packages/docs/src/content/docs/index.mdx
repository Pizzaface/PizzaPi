## What is PizzaPi?

**PizzaPi** is a self-hosted relay server and web UI that wraps the [`pi` coding agent](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi). It streams every event from your local agent session to a browser in real time — so you can monitor, interact, and review code changes from your phone, tablet, or another computer.

## Why PizzaPi?

PizzaPi goes beyond basic terminal access to give you a full remote development experience:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="📱 Installable PWA" icon="document">
    Install PizzaPi as a Progressive Web App on your phone or tablet. Get a native app experience with offline support and home screen access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔔 Push Notifications" icon="approve-check">
    Get notified when sessions complete, agents need input, or errors occur — even when the browser tab is closed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="💬 Inter-Agent Messaging" icon="comment">
    Agents can communicate with each other via `send_message` and `wait_for_message`. Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows from the UI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🖥️ Multi-Runner Support" icon="list-format">
    Connect multiple dev machines (runners) to a single relay. Switch between them from the web UI and manage all your projects in one place.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How It Works

<Steps>
1. **Install the CLI on your dev machine**

   Run `npx @pizzapi/pizza` (or install globally). The CLI wraps the `pi` coding agent and adds relay streaming.

2. **Connect to a relay server**

   On first run, the setup wizard asks for your relay URL and credentials. The CLI opens a persistent WebSocket connection and streams all session events.

3. **Open the web UI in any browser**

   Navigate to your relay's URL. You'll see live token streaming, tool call results, file diffs, and a chat input — all in real time. Works on desktop and mobile.
</Steps>

## Quick Install

```bash
# Run without installing (npx)
npx @pizzapi/pizza

# — or — install globally
npm install -g @pizzapi/pizza
pizzapi
```

<Aside type="tip" title="First run?">
  The first time you run `pizzapi`, a setup wizard walks you through connecting to a relay server and signing in. It takes about 30 seconds — see the [Getting Started](/PizzaPi/getting-started/) guide for details.
