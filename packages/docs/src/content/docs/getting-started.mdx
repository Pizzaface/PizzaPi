import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

PizzaPi has two parts:

| Part | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **CLI** (`pizzapi`) | Wraps `pi` on your dev machine and streams session events to the relay |
| **Relay Server** | Buffers and broadcasts events; hosts the web UI |

You always need the CLI. The relay can be **hosted by someone else** (quickest) or **run yourself** with Docker.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** (or Bun) installed
- **An AI provider API key** — PizzaPi uses the `pi` coding agent under the hood, which needs an API key from at least one provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). Alternatively, a [Claude Pro/Max subscription](https://claude.ai) works via the Claude Code OAuth flow.
- **A relay server URL** — either a hosted relay someone has shared with you, or you'll self-host one in Option B below.

<Aside type="note">
  Don't have an API key yet? [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), and [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) all offer free-tier credits to get started.

## Option A — Use a Hosted Relay (Quickest)

<Steps>
1. **Install the CLI**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="npx (no install)">
     ```bash
     npx @pizzapi/pizza
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="npm (global)">
     ```bash
     npm install -g @pizzapi/pizza
     pizzapi
     ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Bun (global)">
     ```bash
     bun install -g @pizzapi/pizza
     pizzapi
     ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Run first-time setup**

   The first time you run `pizzapi` without a saved config it launches the setup wizard automatically:

   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │        PizzaPi — first-run setup        │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

   Relay server URL [http://localhost:7492]: https://relay.example.com
   Your name (leave blank if account exists): Jordan
   Email: you@example.com
   Password: ••••••••

   Connecting to relay server… ✓
   ✓ API key saved to ~/.pizzapi/config.json
   ✓ Relay: wss://relay.example.com
   ```

   You can re-run setup at any time:

   ```bash
   pizzapi setup
   ```

3. **Start a session**

   ```bash
   pizzapi
   ```

   Open the relay's web UI in your browser — your session is streaming live!
</Steps>

---

## Option B — Self-Host the Relay

Want complete control? Run the relay + web UI yourself.

### The Easy Way: `pizza web`

If you have Docker installed, one command does everything:

```bash
pizzapi web
```

This clones the repo, builds the containers, and starts the relay at **http://localhost:7492**. See [`pizza web`](/PizzaPi/guides/self-hosting/#quickest-pizza-web) for details.

### Manual Setup

<Steps>
1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pizzaface/PizzaPi.git
   cd PizzaPi
   ```

2. **Start the server stack**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up -d
   ```

   | Service | Port | Description |
   |---------|------|-------------|
   | `redis` | 6379 | Session event buffer |
   | `server` | 7492 | Relay API + Web UI |

   The web UI is now live at **http://localhost:7492**.

3. **Install the CLI & connect**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @pizzapi/pizza
   pizzapi setup
   # Relay server URL: http://localhost:7492
   # Email: you@example.com
   # Password: your-password
   ```

4. **Start your first session**

   ```bash
   cd /your/project
   pizzapi
   ```

   Then open **http://localhost:7492** to watch it live.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="No Docker?">
  You can run the server directly with Bun for local development. See the [Development guide](/PizzaPi/reference/architecture/#development) for instructions.

## What You'll See

Once your session is running, open the web UI. Here's what to expect:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Live Token Stream" icon="document">
    The agent's response streams in token-by-token — just like watching it type. Markdown is rendered inline with syntax highlighting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool Calls & Results" icon="setting">
    Every file read, bash command, and edit appears as a collapsible tool call with full input/output. You can see exactly what the agent is doing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File Diffs" icon="list-format">
    File edits show as syntax-highlighted diffs so you can review changes at a glance before the agent moves on.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Todo List" icon="approve-check">
    If the agent creates a task plan, it appears as a live-updating todo list in the sidebar — items move from pending → in progress → done.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

You can type messages in the chat input at the bottom to ask questions, give corrections, or steer the agent — all without touching the terminal.
