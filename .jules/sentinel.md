## 2025-05-24 - Rate Limiting Added to Resource-Intensive Chat Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/chat` endpoint handles processing AI prompts, executing tools, and interacting with the AI model, making it a resource-intensive endpoint in terms of tokens and compute time. However, there was no rate limiting applied to it.
**Learning:** Even if an endpoint uses authentication/sessions, it needs to be protected against resource exhaustion (Denial of Service) and excessive API consumption (financial cost) through proper rate-limiting. Malicious actors, or even runaway client scripts, could easily exhaust available API budgets by hitting an unprotected complex endpoint continuously.
**Prevention:** Implement endpoint-specific rate limits using security utilities like `RateLimiter` to constrain the maximum number of requests allowed from a given client within a designated time window. Ensure this logic intercepts incoming requests prior to resource-heavy operations being performed.
